Make sure to look at the Duraspeed settings in your Android Settings app. Duraspeed will kill processes in order to keep apps in the foreground more performative, and allow battery optimizations. Although this can be helpful, it can also impact your user experience.

In the settings you are able to fully disable Duraspeed, or whitelist particular apps if you prefer.
