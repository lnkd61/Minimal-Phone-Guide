# Getting Started

## Android Setup
Follow the prompts on the screen to set up the device. There are a few things to note:

### Transferring Data

Some users reported battery draining quickly while updating or transferring data from their existing phone (for android users), so it may be a good idea to be fully charged, or use a usb-c splitter to charge while transferring data.

### Setting up Fingerprint
from google docs created by marshall
There is a fingerprint sensor in the power button on the right side of the phone. When you are configuring your fingers it appears that there is no feedback on the screen because the e-ink is not great but you just have to gently take your finger off and on the fingerprint sensor like 20 times until it is registered.


## First Steps After Setup
### System Updates
After going through the initial setup, you'll want to make sure you have the latest updates. E-Paper is pretty new to android so the team is working on updates and those will likely improve the experience of the phone noticably with each update 

    Settings -> System -> System Updates

To access settings, swipe down from the top twice, hit the cog icon, and then look for system, or just use the search bar.

### Checking Duraspeed
There is an setting called duraspeed which can sometimes aggresively kill apps to perserve battery. Your mileage may vary, but it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with it (more on this in troubleshooting)
