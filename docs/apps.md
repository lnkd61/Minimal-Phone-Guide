# App Suggestions

This section is for apps that may work better either for the processor, the e-ink screen, or the resolution, in no particular order.

### Keyboard
    Minimal Keyboard

Gboard, while great, does not work super well with the physical keyboard on the phone.

### Camera
caseyls, silentace07, and alfonso mantero are a few individuals from discord who looked into the camera a lot. Based on their findings, the recommended camera setup is
    
    OpenCamera, Camera2api set, NR (default) setting 

### E-Reader
    KO Reader & Moonreader

### Launchers
    Minimal Launcher, Before Launcher, Niagara Launcher

Launcher work a bit like a desktop in some ways. Minimal Launcher will obviously be updated by the team at TMC, but people have found success with these other launchers, as well as nova (prime).
