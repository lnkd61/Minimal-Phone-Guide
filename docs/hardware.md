## Screen

### Frontlight
from jordan on discord, how to turn off the frontlight (until an official fix is released):

Slide the brightness slider all the way down and without letting go of it just yet, drag it up SLIGHTLY till you see the light turn on, let go and once you exit the eink app it will turn off.

### Locking the Screen
from resolveduser1 on discord, if you are having some difficulty determining whether the screen is locked or not

It helped me to make sure I had the backlight on some while testing because when the phone locks , the backlight will shut off . Once I discovered that , it helped me understand when the phone locked and when it didn't . Now , I trust that the phone locks when I press the button .

One other thing that got me was that if you hold your unlock finger over the power button after a single click to lock , it will unlock itself again . This was hard to understand before I used the backlight trick above .
