## Screen

### Frontlight
from jordan on discord, how to turn off the frontlight (until an official fix is released):

Slide the brightness slider all the way down and without letting go of it just yet, drag it up SLIGHTLY till you see the light turn on, let go and once you exit the eink app it will turn off.

### Locking the Screen
from resolveduser1 on discord, if you are having some difficulty determining whether the screen is locked or not

It helped me to make sure I had the backlight on some while testing because when the phone locks , the backlight will shut off . Once I discovered that , it helped me understand when the phone locked and when it didn't . Now , I trust that the phone locks when I press the button .

One other thing that got me was that if you hold your unlock finger over the power button after a single click to lock , it will unlock itself again . This was hard to understand before I used the backlight trick above .

### Stop screen from waking for every notification
This is a personal preference, but a tip from user j4sb3rg on discord

Minor Keyboard Issue & Fix Incoming

We're aware of one more slight issue with the keyboard:

Issue: Holding down the SHIFT or ALT key while typing quickly may not register correctly.

Temporary Fix: Instead of holding down the key, tap or double-tap (to lock) SHIFT or ALT before selecting the desired character

### WASD Mode
If you want to use WASD for a directional pad such as for games, you can double tap ALT then press SYM. You will notice a directional icon appear in your status bar at the top.
To get out of this mode, press SYM once more.
Note that when you are in this mode, your characters symbols on the keyboard will rearrange such as ALT+M will be an “=” instead of a “,”
